				<p>Most cocktail recipes suggest a style of glassware that is typically used for that drink. This glassware tour will give you an idea of the basic shapes for each style of glass. You will also learn how many ounces each glass typically holds and which types of drinks each is used for. I have also marked a few of the glasses as a "Must-Have" for the well-stocked bar. Use this feature to choose the essential glassware to buy for your new bar.</p>

				<h2>Tips for Buying Glassware</h2>
				<br>
				<p>When shopping for glasses, you will find a variety of designs within each style and this is half of the fun.</p><br>
				
				<ul class="glass1">
					<li>Look for interesting features that match your bar's style.</li><br>
					<li>Don't be afraid to shop second-hand sources. You will find some of the best designs in vintage glassware.</li><br>
					<li>Stay away from the very thin glass. They will break easily and this applies to the stems as well. I have had the stem of a cheaply made margarita glass literally twist off while washing it.</li><br>
				</ul>

				<h2>Glassware Cleaning and Storing Tips</h2><br>
				
				<ul class="glass1">
					<li>Pay attention when hand washing glassware. Dishwater is the last place you want you want to break glass!</li><br>
					<li>Did you break a glass? Pick up little shards of glass with white bread (seriously!).</li><br>
					<li>Rinse your glasses thoroughly to remove soap.</li><br>
					<li>Dry your glasses immediately to avoid water spots.</li><br>
					<li>Never put wet glasses away in the cupboard or glass rack. It can ruin surfaces and there is a potential for mold.</li><br>
					<li>It is best to store glasses upside down. This prevents dust and debris from collecting inside. Also, stemware like cocktail glasses are top-heavy and can easily be knocked over.</li><br>
					<li>Displaying your glassware in full view? Don't forget to dust them!</li><br>
					<li>Consider a glass rack for your stemware, it may end up saving space. Remember that cocktail and margarita glasses are wider than wine glasses. Make sure the rack accommodates those styles or purchase individual racks and space them accordingly.</li><br>

				<h2>List of glassware</h2><br>

				<p>This list of glassware includes drinking vessels (drinkware) and tableware used to set a table for eating a meal, general glass items such as vases, and glasses used in the catering idustry. It dose not include laboratory glasswer.</p>

				<h2>Drinkware</h2><br>

				<p>Drinkware, beverageware (colloquially referred to as cups) is a general term for a vessel intended to contain beverages or liquid foods for drinking or consumption.</p><br>

				<div id="data">
				<p>A beaker is a beverage container, and a term used in parts of the UK.
				A beaker is typically a non-disposable plastic or ceramic cup or mug without a handle, 
				much like a laboratory beaker. Beaker is particularly commonly used to describe a lidded cup designed for toddlers or small children, with a no-spill mouthpiece incorporated into the lid.
				In North American English, the term is almost exclusively used in the laboratory context. 
				Similarly shaped vessels in North American are referred to as "tumblers."</p></div>

				<div id="data-2">
				<p>Beer glassware comprises the drinking vessels made of glass designed or commonly used for drinking beer. Different styles of glassware exist for a number of reasons: they may reflect national traditions; legislation regarding serving measures; practicalities of stacking, washing and avoiding breakage; promotion of commercial breweries; folk art, novelty items or use in drinking games; or complementing different styles of beer for a variety of reasons, including enhancing aromatic volatiles, showcasing the appearance, and having an effect on the beer head. Several kinds of beer glassware have a stem which serves to prevent the body heat of the drinker's hand from warming the beer. Beer glasses are made from a variety of materials not limited to glass, including stoneware, earthenware, pewter, and wood.</p></div>

				<!--Coffee cup-->

				<div id="data-3">
				<p>A coffee cup is a container that coffee and espresso-based drinks are served in. Coffee cups are typically made of glazed ceramic, and have a single handle for portability while the beverage is hot. Ceramic costruction allows a beverage to be drink while hot, providing insulation to the beverage, and quickly washed with cold water without fear of breakage, compared to typical glassware. A coffee cup may also be a disposable cup in which hot beverages, including coffee, can be contained. Disposable coffee cups may be made out of paper or styrofoam. At coffee shops, paper cups are commonly used to give beverages to customers on the go, usually with a coffee cup sleeve to provide insulation against heat transferred through the container.</p></div>

				<p>A cup is a small container used for drinking and carrying drinks. It can be made of wood, plastic, glass, clay, metal, stone, china or other materials, and it might have a stem, handles or other adornments. Cups are used for quenching thirst across a wide range of cultures and social classes, and different styles of cups may be used for different liquids or in different situations.
				Cups have been used for thousands of years for the purpose of carrying food and drink, as well as for decoration. They are mostly used for drinking, though. They are used in certain cultural rituals and to hold objects not intended for drinking such as coins.</p></div>

				<div id="data-5">
				<p>A jar is a rigid, cylindrical or slightly conical container, typically made of glass, ceramic, or plastic, with a wide mouth or opening that can be closed with a lid, screw cap, lug cap, cork stopper, roll-on cap, crimp-on cap, press-on cap, plastic shrink, heat sealed lidding film, an inner seal, a Tamper-evident band, or other suitable means. Jars are used to hold foods or other solids too large to be removed from or cosmetics, medications, and chemicals too viscous to be poured through a bottle's neck. Glass jars—among which the most popular is the mason jar—can be used for storing and preserving items as diverse as jam, pickled gherkin, other pickles, marmalade, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, jalapeño peppers, chutneys, pickled eggs, honey, and many others. Jars are sterilised by putting them in a pressure cooker with boiling water or an oven for a number of minutes. Glass jars are considered microwavable. Some regions[In what country?] have a legally mandated deposit refundable upon return of the jar to its retailer, after which the jar is recycled according to the SPI recycling code for the material.</p></div>

				<p>A mug is a type of cup typically used for drinking hot beverages, such as coffee, hot chocolate, soup, or tea. Mugs usually have handles and hold a larger amount of fluid than other types of cup. Usually a mug holds approximately 8-12 US fluid ounces (350 ml) of liquid; double a tea cup. A mug is a less formal style of drink container and is not usually used in formal place settings, where a teacup or coffee cup is preferred. Shaving mugs are used to assist in wet shaving. Ancient mugs were usually carved in wood or bone, or shaped of clay, while most modern ones are made of ceramic materials such as bone china, earthenware, porcelain, or stoneware. Some are made from strengthened glass, such as Pyrex. Other materials, including enameled metal, plastic, or steel are preferred, when reduced weight or resistance to breakage is at a premium, such as for camping. A travel mug is insulated and has a cover with a small sipping opening to prevent spills. Techniques such as silk screen printing or decals are used to apply decorations such as logos or images, which are fired onto the mug to ensure permanence.</p></div>

				<p>A teacup is a cup for drinking tea. It may be with or without a handle, generally a small one that may be grasped with the thumb and one or two fingers. In some lands it is custom to raise the last finger on the hand, or "pinkie" when drinking from a tea cup. It is typically made of a ceramic material. It is usually part of a set, composed of a cup and a matching saucer or a trio that includes a small cake or sandwich plate. These in turn may be part of a tea set in combination with a teapot, cream jug, covered sugar bowl and slop bowl en suite. Teacups are often wider and shorter than coffee cups. Cups for morning tea are conventionally larger than cups for afternoon tea. Better teacups typically are of fine white translucent porcelain and decorated with patterns that may be en suite with extensive dinner services. Some collectors acquire numerous one-of-a-kind cups with matching saucers. Such decorative cabinet cups may be souvenirs of a location, person, or event. Such collectors may also accumulate silver teaspoons with a decorated enamel insert in the handle, with similar themes. In the culture of China teacups are very small, normally holding no more than 30ml of liquid. They are designed to be used with Yixing teapots or Gaiwan. Countries in the Horn of Africa like Eritrea also use the handleless cups to drink boon which is traditional coffee there. In Russian-speaking cultures and West Asian cultures influenced by the Ottoman Empire tea is often served in a glass held in a separate metal container with a handle, called a zarf. or in Russian a podstakannik. The first small cups specifically made for drinking the beverage tea when it was newly seen in Europe in the 17th century were exported from the Japanese port of Imari or from the Chinese port of Canton. Tea bowls in the Far East did not have handles, and the first European imitations, made at Meissen, were without handles, too. At the turn of the 19th century canns of cylindrical form with handles became a fashionable alternative to bowl-shaped cups.</p></div>

				<div id="data-13">
				<p>Trembleuse or Tasse Trembleuse also Gobelet et soucoupe enfoncé is a drinking cup and saucer which originated in Paris in the 1690s. It was designed to allow people suffering from the trembles to drink a beverage, initially hot chocolate. The cup sits in a saucer with either a well, or a raised rim to prevent the liquid from spilling. Cups were designed with or without handles, and optionally a lid. Many of the most famous porcelain manufacturers, such as Sèvres, Meissen, and Vienna produced trembleuses. Sèvres used the term Gobelet et soucoupe enfoncé for a saucer with a well in catalogues from 1759.</p></div>
